# Enabling the Firewall

The `ufw` is a built-in firewall that can help keep your server secure.

To start, verify that it is not enabled with:

```bash
sudo ufw status
```

It should return that the status is `inactive`.

## Set Rules

You need to configure the rules for your firewall by allowing your processes to maintain connections.

```bash
sudo ufw app list
```

This will print a list of profiles that were pre-generated by your installed applications. There are a couple here that are relevant.

First is `OpenSSH`, which is your SSH connection handler. This should be allowed.

```bash
sudo ufw allow "OpenSSH"
```

> [!ATTENTION]
> You **must** do this step before turning on the firewall, or you will lock yourself out of SSH connections to your server.

Next, if you configured `NGINX` you should see a few profiles available. `Nginx Full` is the one you want, as it allows both HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) connections.

```bash
sudo ufw allow "Nginx Full"
```

If you are *not* using NGINX, you can enable these manually.

```bash
sudo ufw allow http
sudo ufw allow https
```

Or, if you are using custom ports:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 8080
```

(Replacing `8080` with your port number).

Confirm that your rules are all set correctly with:

```bash
sudo ufw show added
```

## Enable Firewall

Once you have set up your rules, you can turn on the firewall.

```bash
sudo ufw enable
```

And you can confirm your rules with:

```bash
sudo ufw status
```

Should you need to, you can turn the firewall back off.

```bash
sudo ufw disable
```
