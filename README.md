# Code Snippets

Some bits of code that I need on occasion, saved here for ease of access.

## Transfer-GitHub-Labels

Browser-run code to export the labels on a GitHub repo, download them, and import them into another repo.

## Optional Workflows

Extra workflows that can be added to a GitHub repo.
- `dependabot`: Configuration for Dependabot to update `npm` packages.
- `merge-conflit`: Labeller for pull requests with merge conflicts.
- `node-ci`: CI to run the `lint` and `build` scripts on a PR.
- `stale`: Labeller to flag stale issues/PRs.

## Git Commands

Helpful commands for the `git` CLI.
- `git-update-fork`: Forces a local repository to match the `master` branch of the original repository. Avoids endless "update" commits.
